          <li>After his charge, there’s a small window where he’ll be slightly vulnerable.</li>
          <li>Use this chance to land a few hits before he recovers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    
      <li class="tutorial20"><b>Beware of His Bees:</b>
        <ul>

          <li>Keep your distance or move quickly to avoid getting surrounded by them.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    
      <li class="tutorial20"><b>Focus on Dodging and Attacking:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The key to defeating Hive Knight is keeping a balance of dodging and striking at the right moments.</li>

      <li class="tutorial21"><b>Dodge Her Attacks:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The God Tamer uses a mix of fast slashing attacks and a charged dash.</li>
          <li>Constantly move and be prepared to dodge or jump to avoid her slashes and dashes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    
      <li class="tutorial21"><b>Deal with the Tamer and the Beast:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The God Tamer has her own set of attacks, while her beast will also be attacking you.</li>
          <li>Focus on keeping a distance from both of them and prioritize dodging to avoid being overwhelmed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    
      <li class="tutorial21"><b>Watch Out for Her Charged Dash:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>When she charges up and dashes at you, it can be deadly if you’re not quick enough to dodge.</li>
          <li>Time your dodge just before the dash to avoid taking major damage.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    
      <li class="tutorial21"><b>Take Advantage of Her Recovery Time:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>After a dash or an attack, there is a small window where she is vulnerable.</li>
          <li>Use this opportunity to attack her while she recovers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    
      <li class="tutorial21"><b>Manage the Beast:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The beast that accompanies the God Tamer can be tricky, but try to focus on avoiding its attacks while staying mobile.</li>
          <li>Once the God Tamer is dealt with, the beast will be easier to manage.</li>
